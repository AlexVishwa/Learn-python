# Added settings for db config in file: `mysite/mysite/settings.py`
# src: Setting up postgres with django: https://youtu.be/KqcS3P32s6Y
# BEWARE: pgadmin is actually a good ui manager for postgres, src above^^.
# Instlled for postgres support
sudo pacman -S python-psycopg2
# Seup migrations and migrate to db
python manage.py makemigrations # ~ This is not specified in django docs though.
python manage.py migrate
# That'll fill the database with appropriate data and you would be able to see lots of tables created by command:
psql -d django_app1 -U postgres -c "\d"
# See the database via psql:

# Creating a super user:
python manage.py createsuperuser # use username as `admin` and choose some passwd.


## ~Sahil, Migrating models after adding Mode definition in `polls/models.py` and adding `polls` app i.e., `polls.apps.PollsConfig` to array i.e., `INSTALLED_APPS` in `mysite/settings.py`.
# DJANGO DOCS: By running makemigrations, you’re telling Django that you’ve made some changes to your models (in this case, you’ve made new ones) and that you’d like the changes to be stored as a migration.
# DJANGO DOCS: Migrations are how Django stores changes to your models (and thus your database schema) - they’re files on disk. You can read the migration for your new model if you like; it’s the file polls/migrations/0001_initial.py. Don’t worry, you’re not expected to read them every time Django makes one, but they’re designed to be human-editable in case you want to manually tweak how Django changes things.
python manage.py makemigrations polls


# DJANGO DOCS: The sqlmigrate command takes migration names and returns their SQL:
python manage.py sqlmigrate polls 0001 # ~Sahil, Here 0001 is the number on the filenames in `polls/migrations/` directory.


# DJANGO DOCS: You can also run python manage.py check; this checks for any problems in your  without making migrations or touching the database.
python manage.py check;
# Output (default):
# System check identified no issues (0 silenced).


# DJANGO DOCS: Now, run migrate again to create those model tables in your database. The migrate command takes all the migrations that haven’t been applied (Django tracks which ones are applied using a special table in your database called django_migrations) and runs them against your database - essentially, synchronizing the changes you made to your models with the schema in the database.
python manage.py migrate


# SHORT NOTES FROM django
# Remember the three-step guide to making model changes:
# 1. Change your models (in models.py).
# 2. Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
# 3. Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database.

Directory structure

```txt
mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        asgi.py
        wsgi.py
```

These files are:

- The outer `mysite/` root directory is a container for your project. Its name doesn’t matter to Django; you can rename it to anything you like.
- `manage.py`: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. You can read all the details about `manage.py` in [`django-admin` and `manage.py`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/django-admin/).
- The inner `mysite/` directory is the actual Python package for your project. Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to import anything inside it (e.g. `mysite.urls`).
- `mysite/__init__.py`: **An empty file that tells Python that this directory should be considered a Python package.** If you’re a Python beginner, read [more about packages](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#tut-packages) in the official Python docs.
- `mysite/settings.py`: Settings/configuration for this Django project. [Django settings](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/settings/) will tell you all about how settings work.
- `mysite/urls.py`: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of your Django-powered site. You can read more about URLs in [URL dispatcher](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/http/urls/).
- `mysite/asgi.py`: An entry-point for ASGI-compatible web servers to serve your project. See [How to deploy with ASGI](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/deployment/asgi/) for more details.
- `mysite/wsgi.py`: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project. See [How to deploy with WSGI](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/howto/deployment/wsgi/) for more details.

## What is wsgi and asgi?

```txt
WSGI is the Web Server Gateway Interface. It is a specification that describes how a web server communicates with web applications, and how web applications can be chained together to process one request.

WSGI is a Python standard described in detail in PEP 3333.
src: https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what.html
```

**Only things you need to know between wsgi and asgi:** https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/difference-between-wsgi-and-asgi-807158ed1d4c

- ASGI is successor of WSGI. WSGI did not have asynchronous callables.
